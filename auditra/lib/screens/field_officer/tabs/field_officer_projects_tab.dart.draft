// If FieldOfficerProjectCard is in the main directory or valid path, we need to correct this.
// Based on previous file views, it seems FieldOfficerProjectCard was used in the dashboard.
// I'll assume it's available or I'll need to check where it is defined. 
// It was likely defined in field_officer_dashboard.dart or imported.
// Let's check imports in field_officer_dashboard.dart first to be sure where components are. 
// Actually, I'll defer the write until I verify where FieldOfficerProjectCard is.
// But to be efficient, I'll check imports first.
